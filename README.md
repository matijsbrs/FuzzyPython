# FuzzyPython
A project to learn Python and work with FuzzyLogic

The project consists of a (very) basic FuzzyLogic set. 
I made this code to learn Pyhton and I want to automate
the control of my thermostat. 
The fuzzy sets can be loaded from a JSON file. 
in the future I plan to also add stuf

Adding support for external rule file.
